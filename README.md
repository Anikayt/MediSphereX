# Hospital Management System - MERN Stack
## Overview
This project is a dynamic and fully-featured Hospital Management System built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). The system allows patients to book appointments online, select their preferred doctors, and communicate with the hospital. All operations, including doctor and patient records management, are controlled by a single admin user, ensuring a secure and centralized management structure.

## Features
Online Appointment Booking: Patients can schedule appointments with their chosen doctors through an intuitive online interface.
Doctor and Patient Records Management: The system maintains comprehensive records of doctors and patients, accessible only by the admin.
Doctor Selection by Patients: Patients have the flexibility to choose their preferred doctors for consultations.
Messaging System: Users can send messages directly to the hospital, facilitating communication for inquiries, feedback, or requests.
Admin Dashboard: A powerful admin dashboard allows the administrator to manage all aspects of the system, including appointments, doctor-patient records, and incoming messages.
Technologies Used
MongoDB: For the database, storing all data related to patients, doctors, appointments, and messages.
Express.js: As the backend framework, handling API requests and server-side logic.
React: For building the responsive and dynamic front-end interface.
Node.js: Serving as the runtime environment for executing server-side JavaScript.
Cloudinary API: Integrated for secure and efficient management of image uploads, such as patient and doctor profiles.
